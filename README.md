# AI-Powered-Personalized-Learning-Platform

Project submission for AITM Hackathon 2025
🏆 Ranked 6th out of 35 teams
🚀 Overview
An intelligent, full-stack web application built using Django, Machine Learning (KNN), and Gemini GenAI API, designed to dynamically tailor learning paths based on user input and progress. The platform addresses major gaps in educational equity and scalability, especially across low-resource schools in India.
🧠 Key Features
- 🔄 Adaptive Learning Paths: Machine Learning (KNN) algorithm personalizes roadmaps based on user goals and performance.
- 🧪 AI-Generated Practice: Leveraged Gemini API to generate contextual practice questions and learning materials (e.g., LeetCode-style challenges).
- 🎯 Scoring and Feedback: Real-time analysis and GenAI-based scoring to help learners track their progress effectively.
- 🧑‍🏫 Teacher Dashboard: Auto-monitoring and smart reports give educators a clear view of each student’s journey.
- 🌐 Google Cloud AI Integration: Multilingual, agentic teaching support using Google’s advanced AI services.
🌟 Purpose and Impact
India has 14.9 lakh+ schools, many operating with:
- One teacher for 30+ students across multiple grades
- Less than 10% tech integration
This platform:
- Enables multi-career path preparation even in tech-scarce environments
- Assists overwhelmed teachers with an intelligent AI agent
- Provides personalized education, even in remote or underserved areas
